title: GGI Format
description: 'A custom binary format for storing model and sprite data'
---

## Overview

```c
typedef struct {
    GGIHeader_t header;
    ModelTable_t model_table;
} GGIData_t;
```

## Header

```c
typedef struct {
    int32_t sprite_group_index_1;
    int32_t sprite_group_index_2_enc;
    int32_t sprite_group_index_3_enc; // fancy numbers / text
    int32_t sprite_group_index_4_enc; // hidden level particles (do not seem affected though)
    int32_t sprite_group_index_5_enc; // bonus meter
    int32_t sprite_group_index_6_enc; // hourglass sprite to the end

    int32_t hourglass_anim_offset_enc; // hourglass spin animation
    int32_t unk_offset1_enc; // block lighting related
    int32_t unk_offset2_enc; // possibly ignored in game, doesn't seem to be read anywhere
    int32_t dummy_offset_enc; // offset to "dummy!!!" text
    int32_t ball_anim_enc; // ball bounce animation
    int32_t sprites_offset_enc;
    int32_t file_size_enc;
    int32_t entity_table_offset_enc;
    int32_t object_table_offset_enc;
} GGIHeader_t;
```

The first part of the header contain indexes to different groups of sprites:

1. Sprites relating to object collection and teleportation affects.
2. Sprites relating to the sun glare and scores / loading screen blue background boxes.
3. Sprites relating to menu text elements.
4. Sprites relating to the hidden level sky particles, although **does not seem to affect them**.
5. Sprites relating to the bonus level HUD.
6. Sprites relating to the hourglass hud and various other text elements; the rest of the sprites.

```c
// decoding the sprite indexes
sprite_group_index_1 = sprite_group_index_1;
sprite_group_index_2 = sprite_group_index_1 + sprite_group_index_2_enc;
sprite_group_index_3 = sprite_group_index_2 + sprite_group_index_3_enc;
sprite_group_index_4 = sprite_group_index_3 + sprite_group_index_4_enc;
sprite_group_index_5 = sprite_group_index_4 + sprite_group_index_5_enc;
sprite_group_index_6 = sprite_group_index_5 + sprite_group_index_6_enc;
```

Every offset contained in the header is encoded in the following manner for an unknown reason:

```c
// decoding the first six offsets
hourglass_anim_offset = hourglass_anim_offset_enc * 2 + 0x34;
unk_offset1    = unk_offset1_enc    * 2 + hourglass_anim_offset;
unk_offset2    = unk_offset2_enc    * 2 + unk_offset1;
dummy_offset   = dummy_offset_enc   * 2 + unk_offset2;
ball_anim      = ball_anim_enc      * 2 + dummy_offset;
sprites_offset = sprites_offset_enc * 2 + ball_anim;
file_size      = file_size_enc      * 2 + sprites_offset;

// decoding the two table offsets
entity_table_offset = ((entity_table_offset_enc >> 2) + 0xD) * 4;
object_table_offset = ((object_table_offset_enc >> 2) + 0xD) * 4;
```

## Model Table

The model offset table begins at offset **$3C** in the file and is where the game references each object's model. Every model has **three** different levels of detail (LOD), with the first being the **highest quality** when the player is closest to the model, and the third being the **lowest quality** when the player is further from the model. Every entry in the table contains offsets to these different quality models, with each offset being denoted with an "L" in the structure above.

Padding between entries in the table are always set to **-1**.

The last two entries in the table most likely refer to the last two unused presents in the demo.

Each offset is **relative** to a specific offset:

-   Entity offsets are relative from **0x3C**.
-   Object offsets are relative from **0x1CC**.

## Model Data

```c
typedef struct {
    short unknown;
    short unknown;
    short unknown;
    short unknown;
    short stp_blend_operator;
    short unknown;
    int32_t unknown; // set to 24 for objects, 28 for balls
    IndexBuffer_t index_buffer;
    VertexBuffer_t vertex_buffer;
} ModelData_t;

typedef struct {
    int32_t size;
    int32_t unknown;
    char indices[size - 32];
    int32_t unknown = 1;
    int32_t unknown = 0;
} IndexBuffer_t;

typedef struct {
    typedef struct {
        short x1;
        short y1;
        short x2;
        short y2;
        short x3;
        short y3;
        short z1;
        short z2;
        short z3;
        short padding = 0;
    } VertexBuffer_Group_t;

    int32_t vertexBufferCount = 1; // vertex buffer count (32 for moving spike)
    int32_t size; // size of vertices section
    VertexBuffer_Group_t vertices[][];
} VertexBuffer_t;

typedef struct {
    typedef struct {
        char r;
        char g;
        char b;
        char vFlags;
    } VertexColor_t; // 4 bytes

    int32_t unknown = 1;
    int32_t size; // size of vertex colors section
    VertexColor_t vertex_colors[size / 4];
} VertexColors_t;
```

Not every model in the game has a vertex count in multiples of three. Since the vertex position buffer of a model is grouped into **threes**, the leftover vertex positions are set to **0**. For example, the _arrow model_.

### Vertex Flags

Each vertex color attribute contains an extra byte with flags that specifies additional information about the vertex (vFlags):

| Bit | Type               |
| --- | ------------------ |
| 1   | Unused (0)         |
| 2   | Unused (0)         |
| 3   | Unused (1)         |
| 4   | Unknown            |
| 5   | Tri (0) / Quad (1) |
| 6   | Unused (0)         |
| 7   | Transparent        |
| 8   | Unused (0)         |

## Hourglass Sprite Animation

There is a section dedicated to the hourglass flip animation that is **1920** bytes in size. This animation data is the exact same across all known GGI files.

## Unknown Section 1

This section is currently unknown, and seems to affect block lighting. It is **8192** bytes in size, and is also the exact same across all known GGI files.

## Unknown Section 2

This section is also unknown, and does not seem to be referenced in later releases of the game. It is also **8192** bytes in size, and is also the exact same across all known GGI files.

## Dummy Section

This section contains the text "dummy!!!\r\n\r\n".

## Ball Animation Section

```c
typedef struct {
    short x;
    short y;
    short z;
} RelativePositionOffset_t;

typedef struct {
    short anim_frames;
    short padding[3];
    short y_start;
    short z_start;
    RelativePositionOffset_t position_offsets[anim_frames - 1];
} BallAnim_t;

typedef struct {
    short anim_frames;
    short padding[3];
    short y_start;
    short z_start;
    RelativePositionOffset_t position_offsets[];
    short x_end;
} BallAnim_t;
```

This section contains data relating to the ball jumping, including jumping forward. Each short position value offsets the ball in that relative direction. Here's an example of the first and last 4 frames of animation from Kula World:

```
0 0 0 (y_start and z_start)
-48 61 0
-96 117 0
-142 168 0
...
-941 158 0
-969 110 0
-997 56 0
-1024 0 0
```

The Y and Z position start of at 0, and each frame the relative X position is decremented when jumping forward and the Y is incremented for height. At the end of the animation, the Y starts decrementing again until it reaches 0, back to its original position and thus landing the ball.

This section was updated for the Roll Away release, with the animation lasting longer and going slightly into the floor upon landing. This is what causes the [floor clip glitch](https://youtu.be/G6RH7ERGCtI?t=105) in Roll Away.

## Sprites

The first value in the sprite section is the amount of sprites (int32_t). Immediately following this value are all the sprites, which use the following structures:

```c
typedef struct {
    short bpp;
    short blend_op;
    CLUT_t clut;
    Texture_t texture;
} Sprite_t;

typedef struct {
    short vram_x;
    short vram_y;
    short use_prev;
    short padding = 0;
    if (bpp != 16) {
        short data[bpp == 8 ? 256 : 16];
    }
} CLUT_t;

typedef struct {
    short vram_x;
    short vram_y;
    short width; // actual width, not in framebuffer pixels
    short height;
    if (bpp != 16) {
        char data[bpp == 8 ? (width * height) : (width * height) / 2];
    } else {
        short data[width * height];
    }
} Texture_t;
```

After each sprite's texture, there **may** be extra bytes (which some contain garbage data) to align to the 4 byte boundary.

When a sprite uses **16 bits per pixel**, each pixel is represented directly using 16 bit color instead of a color lookup table (CLUT), and therefore the values for the associated CLUT are set to **-1** in this bit depth (different in the first demo, see below). The only sprite that uses this bit depth is a 2x1 completely white sprite, and its current use in game is **unknown**.

Unique to only the first demo of the game (Kula Quest beta), the 4 CLUT values for a 16 bit sprite are not included, thus after the **bpp and blend operator** values starts the **Texture_t** structure.
