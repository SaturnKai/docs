title: Level Format
description: 'A custom binary format for storing level data'
---

## Overview

Kula World uses a custom binary format for storing level data. This format does not have its own extension, and is mostly the same across all versions of the games with slight differences.

**Things to Note:**

-   This format uses [**little endian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).
-   Every value in this format is a 2 byte signed integer. `(int16_t)`

## General Structure

```
00000h  13310h  Block Data
13310h  2       Block Count
13312h  2       Unused
13314h  2       Property Count
......  ......  Property List
```

```c
typedef struct {
    short blocks[39304];  // (34 ^ 3 blocks)
    short blockCount;
    short padding;
    short propertyCount;

    /* Block Properties[propertyCount] */

    LevelInfoProperty_t levelInfo;
} LevelData_t;
```

## Block Data

Every level in the game is essentially a 34x34x34 grid of blocks, with some blocks containing custom properties. The first block is defined at the top, left, back corner of the level, which is at coordinate **0, 0, 0**. The last block ends at the bottom, right, front corner of the level, which is at coordinate **33, 33, 33**.

-   X indicates left and right.
-   Y indicates up and down.
-   Z indicates forward and backward (depth).

The first **0x13310** bytes of the file represent the block data and indicate which block in the grid is of what type. Every 2 bytes indicate a single block, each time incrementing the Y position. This continues until the Y position reaches 33, which is when the Z position is incremented, and Y is reset back to 0. Once the Z position reaches 33, the X position is incremented and Y and Z are reset back to 0. These blocks are read until the position of the file reaches the end of the **block data section**, which is at offset **0x13310** (which as stated previously is the size of this section).

Knowing that every block is represented as a signed 2 byte short, and it's position in the level is determined by where it appears in the block data section, here is what the 2 bytes actually represent:

-   `FF FF` indicates an air block, or nothing. Nothing at all is placed there, and is completely ignored.
-   `00 00` indicates a block with no special properties at all; i.e. a block that doesn't contain any objects or is of a specific type.
-   `01 00` indicates a fire block, which is just a regular block but with fire patches on all sides with no objects or any other properties.
-   `02 00` indicates the same as above, but as an ice block.
-   `03 00` indicates the same as above, but as an invisible block.
-   `04 00` indicates the same as above, but as an acid block.
-   `05 00` or above (ex. `06 00`, `07 00`, etc.) indicates a block with special properties, such as a crumbling or laser block, or a block that contains items and/or objects. The first block of this type must start at **5**, and is incremented for every next special block. A block of this type has coresponding [property data](#property-list). This number can be incremented until the near 2 byte integer limit of `FD FF`, as `FE FF` is **reserved** and is automatically placed in the game's memory for representing laser block segments, which is unimportant for understanding the format.

## Position Types

There are 2 main types of positioning used in this format: **block coordinates** and **entity coordinates**. Here's an example of the different coordinates:

-   `11 00 10 00 11 00` - Block Coordinate
-   `00 22 00 20 9C 20` - Entity Coordinate

The block coordinate system is mainly used for positioning block properties and block positioning in general. Objects and entities in game that need to use finer position values use the entity coordinate system, such as the ball and the current moving block position.

An entity coordinate value is **double** the amount of a block coordinate value, and the bytes are swapped, with the first byte as fine tune. In the example above, we have a block with an item using the block coordinate and a ball on top of the same block using the entity coordinate. The X and Z values are the same, while the Y coordinate is slightly above the block.

Here are the two different structures used throughout this document to define the type of positioning used:

```c
typedef struct {
    short x;
    short z;
    short y;
} Position_Block_t;

typedef struct {
    short x;
    short z;
    short y;
} Position_Entity_t;
```

## Property List

As stated above, there are a lot of different types of special blocks used in the game, and each one needs additional information defined below at the end of the file, right after the block data section (**0x13310**). Each property is a chunk of **256 bytes**. As an example, here is the first property in the first level of HIRO:

```
013310h   14 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 07 00 00 00 00 00 02 00
013320h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 F4 01 01 00 FF FF FF FF
013330h   FF FF 1E 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
013340h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
013350h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
013360h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
013370h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
013380h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
013390h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
0133A0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0133B0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
0133C0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0133D0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0133E0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0133F0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
013400h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
```

### Object Block - 0:4

The following structure below applies to blocks that contain **objects** (items / gizmos). **Moving, crumbling, flashing, and laser blocks** follow a different structure, and have dedicated sections respectively below.

```c
typedef struct {
    short blockType;  // 0 - 4 (Regular, Fire, ...)
    BlockObject_t top;
    BlockObject_t right;
    BlockObject_t front;
    BlockObject_t back;
    BlockObject_t left;
    BlockObject_t bottom;
    short padding[28];
    Position_Block_t position;
} BlockProperty_Object_t;
```

Each object contains **32 bytes** of data:

```c
typedef struct {
    short id;
    short orientation;
    short variant;
    short state;
    short objectIndex;
    short targetProp1;  // buttons and transporters only
    short targetProp2;  // buttons and transporters only
    short animationModelIndex;  // memory only (related to vertex buffer index)
    short y;
    short rotationType;
    short animationValue1;   // memory only
    short animationValue2;   // memory only
    short animationValue3;   // memory only
    short rotationSpeed;
    short animationCounter;  // memory only
    short animationState;    // memory only
} BlockObject_t;
```

Every object in game has a completely unique **ID** that indicates what item to put there. In combination, some items can have different **variants** as well. For example, a coin has the ID `0x25` and the following variants: **Bronze, Gold, and Blue**. Some objects have different **states** as well, such as a transporter being powered on or off, or an item being uncollected or collected.

Only some objects however have different **orientations**, which is used to specify the direction for the object. For example, arrows use the orientation value to determine which direction to face in, and the player spawn uses this value to determine which way to face when spawned into the level.

Some objects have an **object index**, which is incremented starting from 0 for every object. This value is not required to be set in file as it's automatically set in memory. In the first two demos, the **y position**, **rotationType**, and **rotationSpeed** fields are required to be set correctly, as they determine how far above an object is above its block, and how it is spun / animated. In the main games, these fields are **ignored** and hardcoded in the game's code, therefore not required and modifiable.

The **animation values**, **counter**, and **state** fields are not set in file, and are automatically populated and used in memory.

Lastly are the two **target property** fields, which are only used by transporters and buttons. These two fields specify what object(s) to toggle when the transporter / button is powered or unpowered (toggled), and where the transporter will send the player to, respectively. They both act as positions, and follow this principle:

```c
short propertyIndex;
short side;
ushort position = (propertyIndex * 16) + side;
```

As an example, let's look at some location data: `D0 01` and `72 01`. The first location is at index **29**, as the maximum value for the first byte is `F0` (16), and the second byte is incremented due to 29 > 16, which leaves 13, and translates to `D0` in hex. Since only the first digit in the byte represents the index, it would be `D0 01`. Lastly, the second digit in the first byte is 0, which targets the top side of the block.

Using this knowledge, the index of the second location is **23**, which is `70 01`. Since the side we want to target in the second location is 2, the second digit is the first byte is set as such, leaving us with `72 01` as a result. Both of these locations target the **top** side of the block with the **29th property**, and the **right** side of the block with the **23rd property**, respectively.

It's worth noting that in the first demo, buttons power themselves when pressed and only contain one slot, being **target property 1**. In all other versions of the games, buttons have two slots and **do not** power themselves when pressed. This means buttons themselves need power, so often times one of the slots are used to power itself. However, it's worth noting that only the **target property 2** can be used to power the button itself.

### Moving Block - 5

```c
typedef struct {
    short blockType = 5;
    short direction;
    short orientation;
    short unknown;
    Position_Block_t positionFrom;
    Position_Block_t positionTo;
    short padding[6];
    short unknown;
    short length;
    short speed;
    short padding;
    short blockID;
    short padding[98];
    Position_Entity_t currentPosition;
    short unknown[3];  // Always set to: 00 01 00 01 00 01
} BlockProperty_Moving_t;
```

A single block is placed in the starting position, which is known as the **origin**. Based on the length, that many blocks including the origin will be placed in the direction depending on the direction type:

-   `00`, `05` - Positive Y
-   `01`, `04` - Positive X
-   `02`, `03` - Positive Z

The direction specifies what direction the moving block needs to travel in order to reach its **to position**:

-   `00 00` indicates up.
-   `01 00` indicates right.
-   `02 00` indicates forward.
-   `03 00` indicates back.
-   `04 00` indicates left.
-   `05 00` indicates down.
-   Any other value causes the moving block to not move at all.

For example, if the block length is **1**, no other blocks will be placed as the origin block is apart of the length. If the length is **3** and the direction is set to **1**, **2 blocks** will be placed in the **positive X** direction. The moving block starts at the starting position (which is the **current position**), moves to the **to position**, and then moves between **from** and **to** position. The maximum length a moving block can be is **4**, as the texture data the block stores in memory inside its property overwrites other information about the moving block, as well as the next property.

The **orientation** of the moving block indicates how the texture is wrapped onto the block. If this value is not set correctly, the block's collision will not work properly and will often crash the game.

-   `00 00` indicates up and down.
-   `01 00` indicates left and right.
-   `02 00` indicates forward and backward.
-   Any other value defaults to up and down.

The **speed** indicates how many times the current position is incremented / decremented per frame and the **block ID** is set to the block ID that represents this property in the block data section.

### Crumbling Block - 6

```c
typedef struct {
    short blockType = 6;
    short state = 1;
    Position_Entity_t position;
    short padding[120];
    Position_Block_t position;
} BlockProperty_Crumbling_t;
```

Crumbling blocks have the following state values, although they should be set to **1** in file:

-   **0** indicates the crumble block is gone.
-   **1** indicates the crumble block is active.
-   **2** indicates the crumble block is crumbling, but is not used.
-   **3** indicates the crumble block is crumbling.
-   Any other value causes the crumble block to still be active, but will not make a sound when touched.

The crumble block contains entity positioning, and are set as the exact block coordinate of the crumble block, even though it seems to not have an effect in game when changed to a different value. The **240 bytes** of padding are usually set to **-1**, but strangely enough some crumble blocks have object block data and other weird structures. Although they have no effect, it's still interesting to see that maybe some crumble blocks were intended to contain objects as well.

### Flashing Block - 7

```c
typedef struct {
    short blockType = 7;
    short index = -1;    // memory only
    short sync;
    short state = -1;    // memory only
    short counter = -1;  // memory only
    short padding[120];
} BlockProperty_Flashing_t;
```

Similar to moving spikes, flashing blocks also contain a **sync** value, which can be between **0 and 3** and specifies in what order of timing the flashing block will appear. Occasionally, just like crumble blocks, the **240 bytes** of padding may contain weird structures, but have no affect at all.

### Laser Block - 8

```c
typedef struct {
    short blockType = 8;
    short unknown;
    short direction;
    short enabled;
    Position_Block_t positionFrom;
    Position_Block_t positionTo;
    short padding[7];
    short unknown = 1;
    short padding[2];
    short blockID;
    short padding;
    short color;
    short targetProp;
} BlockProperty_Laser_t;
```

The direction specifies what direction the laser block needs to look in to reach its **to position**:

-   0 indicates up.
-   1 indicates right.
-   2 indicates forward.
-   3 indicates back.
-   4 indicates left.
-   5 indicates down.

Changing the **color** property to values other than the 4 color values start to change the laser texture itself, however the game will crash upon turning it on. **Enabled** specifies whether the laser block is enabled by default when the level is started. Same as moving blocks, laser's also contain a **block ID** field that should be set to the block ID that represents this property in the block data section.

Lastly, laser blocks contian a **target property** field for specifying which block and face to toggle when the laser's power is toggled, similar to transporters.

### Level Flag Property - 9

The flag property is optional and if set is always behind the level information property. This property is used for setting flags for the level and does not tie to any block at all:

```c
typedef struct {
    short isHidden;
    short isReverseInvisible;
    short padding[122];
} LevelFlagProperty_t;
```

This property is very simple and only has two flags, which are set to true or false depending if they're set to 1 or 0 respectively. The first flag specifies if the current level is a **hidden level**, and the second flag specifies if the current level uses **reverse-invisible blocks**.

Similar to crumble and flashing blocks, this property usually contains **a lot** of weird structures in its padding, and sometimes this property is added to a level that doesn't use any of its flags.

```
014010h   11 00 11 00 11 00 09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
014020h   00 00 00 00 FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
014030h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
014040h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
014050h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
014060h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
014070h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
014080h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
014090h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00
0140A0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0140B0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 0A 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
0140C0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 01 03 00 FF FF FF FF
0140D0h   FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0140E0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
0140F0h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
014100h   FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
014110h   11 00 13 00 11 00 ..
```

Take this property from **LEVEL 31** as an example. We can see that it's definitely a flag property, but doesn't have any of its flags set. Even stranger however, we can see that it contains data for a bounce pad on the underside of the block, and even has a block position set for it in the next property. It is unknown why this occurs, but it does not have an affect on the level at all.

### Level Information Property - 666

At the end of the level binary, there is an extra property that contains basic information about the level itself. Although most of these values are unknown, they do not seem to have an affect on the level at all. This property has a block type of **666**, but is not tied to any block.

<Note>
    Some levels do not contain this property, notably the first Kula Quest demo.
    This property is not required, so the game will default to specific values
    if this property is not present.
</Note>

```c
typedef struct {
    short id = 666;
    Position_Block_t unknown;
    short unknown[2];
    short startTime;
    short padding[121];
} LevelInfoProperty_t;
```

Based on my research, there is evidence to suggest that the **unknown block position** value is a metadata position value based on the **last modified block** in Kula World's original level editor:

1. A fruit was accidentally placed in [Kula World's]() FINAL 3 level. As final levels are not supposed to contain fruit, this object was removed in the [Roll Away]() release of the game.
   This unknown position value just so happened to update to the removed fruit's block position.
2. A change was made for LEVEL 133 on the [Kula Quest]() release to the green gem where it was moved from the fire block to in front of the key. The unknown position value also updated
   to the block that the gem was moved to.
3. In the first level of the game, this position value points to the block that contains the farther right bronze coin, which happened to be moved forward and changed from a gold to a bronze coin from earlier versions of the game.

This is just some examples, but one could reasonably conclude that this position value was likely metadata as it is **never** referenced from within the game's programming. The two **unknown short** values before the start time value are also ignored in game, but seem to be always in multiples of 5 and sometimes negative.

The only confirmed value in this property is the **start time**, which specifies the amount of time the level starts with in seconds. The game calculates the amount of time by multiplying this value by **50**, which is the PAL's game framerate. For reference, the game decrements `currentTime` every frame of unpaused gameplay, and ends the level if it reaches 0.

In Kula World and Roll Away, the time is calculated by multiplying this value by **50**, which is the framerate of the PAL version:

```c
// SLUS_007.24: 0x35F5C
// currentTime: 0xA573C

// checks if the block's type is 666, meaning the level info property exists;
// if so, set currentTime to the property's 6th index (startingTime) * 50.
if (*propertyData == 0x29a) {
    currentTime = propertyData[6] * 0x32;
}

// if the level info property doesn't exist, default to 4950.
else {
    currentTime = 0x1356;
}
```

_Kula World and Roll Away function the same here, so Roll Away is used as an example._

In Kula Quest, the time is calculated by multiplying this value by **60**, which is the framerate of the NTSC version. An additional check was added if the value is **5940**, which is the maximum time value (99) and is set to **7140** if so to allow additional level time:

```c
// SCPS_100.64: 0x362C4
// currentTime: 0xA12EC

// checks if the block's type is 666, meaning the level info property exists;
// if so, set currentTime to the property's 6th index (startingTime) * 50.
if (*propertyData == 0x29a) {
    currentTime = propertyData[6] * 0x3c;
}

// if the level info property doesn't exist, default to 4950.
else {
    currentTime = 0x1be4;
}

// if the currentTime was set to 5940, default to 7140 to allow more time.
if (currentTime == 0x1734) {
    currentTime = 0x1be4;
}
```
