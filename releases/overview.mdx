## Demos

The game has been distributed on a multitude of different demo discs, all of which are documented here.

### Demo 1

This is the earliest release of Kula World currently known to exist, when it was originally supposed to be named Kula Quest world wide.

    <Card
        title="Registered Users Demo 02 (Europe)"

The following demos of the same type contain unique differences:

    <Card

        icon="link"
        href="/releases/SCED-00936"
    >
        This demo contains a **TEST.CTI** file containing debug information
        related to the game.

    <Card
        title="Euro Demo 10-01 (Germany)"
        icon="link"
        href="/releases/SCED-00936"
    >
        Music is bugged and is completely silent throughout the game despite the
        game files being identical to other demo versions of the same type.
        Additionally, the demo disc itself titles the game as "Kula World"
        despite the demo's common name being Kula Quest.
